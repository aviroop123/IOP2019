1) Study the various methods involving matrix multiplication and their time complexity. 
2) Determine benchmarks for each method and determine in which situation, which method will be most efficient.
3) Use the different methods of multiplication in computing the inverse and the root of a matrix.
4) Implement these methods in C++ to be used as a template library.
